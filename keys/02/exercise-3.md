## Chapter ["Algorithms"](https://comp-think.github.io/book/02.pdf), exercise 3

### Text
The previous chapter, entitled [“Introduction to Computational Thinking”](https://comp-think.github.io/book/01.pdf), illustrates two different algorithms, expressed in natural language, for implementing the Fibonacci function. Create two distinct flowcharts to implement both of them.

### Answer
#### Flowchart for Fibonacci, definition 1
